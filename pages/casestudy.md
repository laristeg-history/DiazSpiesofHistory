This dossier supports my bid for tenure as Associate Professor of History on the basis of research. My work as a digital historian since 2015 has led me to a research trajectory focused on the integration of new digital methods and collaborative practices in the production of historical scholarship. This research agenda centers on *Design-Based History Research (DBHR)*, a digital-history tool- and method-design process that documents change and continuity over time in the context of a digital-history tool's life cycle. DBHR addresses the choices we make as a field about how we use new tools and methods, digital and traditional alike, choices that have long-term historiographic implications for our discipline.

***When historians use tools designed by people in other disciplines, their disciplinary needs shape our analysis. The methods we use to integrate those tools into our historical analysis--from integrating the simplest of search queries, to the use of complex digital tools for in-depth analysis--also have implications for the work of a historian. One of the contributions DBHR makes to the practice of history is to shape the future of our research as a field through the concurrent and intertwined development of historical theory, digital-history tools, and historical methods.*** 

My work has been supported by $2.25 million in grants (2 NSF grants and 2 private foundation grants) across a variety of in-progress projects rooted in [Design-Based History Research](/casestudy). From [a network-analysis tool for historians](/items/01_netcreate.html) to [a web site template and workflow for communities archiving their own histories](/items/02_communityarchive.html), each of my digital-history projects integrates digital-history tool design and methods development in different measure and with various collaborators that extend the impact of my work both to subfields within history and beyond the field of history.

## Why Do We Need Design-Based History Research?

Where argument-driven digital history starts with archival primary sources, DBHR treats the stages of a digital history tool and the methods historians marshal to use that tool as primary source material. These "primary source" models for using digital methods in historical analysis drive a cycle of theoretically-motivated tool design and building which is then interspersed with small-scale testing intended to provide proof-of-concept theoretical models for disciplinary innovation usable by other researchers.

One research project well into its development cycle offers a microcosmic view of the integrated, longitudinal approach around which I’ve structured one arm of my DBHR practice. [Net.Create](https://www.netcreate.org){:target="_blank"} is an [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1848655){:target="_blank"}- and private-foundation-funded network-analysis tool designed specifically to address the gaps between purely quantitative  and the evidence-based research needs of historians working with change and continuity over time.

## Network Analysis Tool Design as Historiography

The historical method asks us to tell evidence-based stories about trends and about the individual people who follow or buck those trends. From that angle, network analysis is a good fit for historians; in its most simplistic form, networks are an aggregate analysis structure built from the ground up around documentation of one-on-one interactions. We can visualize those interactions by turning individual actors into circles (nodes) and drawing lines (edges) between them for each interaction they have. Many of these dyadic interactions added together makes a network. As an actor participates in more interactions, its representative node gets bigger, showing us how important that node is to our overall story and drawing other closely connected nodes toward it in the network visualization.

Several quantitatively focused features of network analysis that are then emphasized by features in network analysis software make network analysis much less approachable for most historians. Networks in data science are often downloaded from large "complete" datasets with very rigidly defined relationships and no sourcing of evidence for interaction at the individual level. In some cases, the names of the network actors are even reduced to numbers because network analysts are more interested in generalizable patterns across many networks and less in the individual lives of the people who make up the network. Anonymized quantitative measures of networks drive network-analys with little consideration for citations, interpretation, argumentation and revisions or changes to the network relationships mid-project.

Net.Create changes that. Rather than simply accommodating a few changes to data-science network-analysis software, Net.Create's features are designed from the ground up for historians through a process of iterative research outlined in a 2023 article at the Journal of Digital History, "Designing Our Digital Past: Anchoring Digital-History Tool Development in the Historical Method Through Design-Based History Research". An easy-to-use hand-entry interface encourages historians working in teams with research assistants to debate relationships and their particularities, with required citations from primary and secondary sources for each interaction, filters that highlight gaps in evidence, and a flexible categorization system that allows researchers to assign multiple relationships to interactions and change interactions or agency types mid-project). With Net.Create, historians can grapple with relationships that can't be reduced to simple, rigid definitions and do so in a piece of software built for historians by a historian.

As with archive-based book projects, DBHR projects are shaped around revisions and review processes. I've led Net.Create through 8 rounds of design revision since 2015, each one focused on a specific design feature or two that supports the humanistic use of network science, with testing and review at each stage. I took on the programming tasks for the first few stages of Net.Create's revision from 2015-2018, which were designed around my own citation needs and collaboration needs with several close research partners and with internal funding from IU. In 2018, Net.Create received a competitive peer-reviewed grant from the NSF, at which point I took on grant leadership for two rounds of revision with a team focused on adding both more refined support for the simpler historiographic-debate considerations (citations, note-taking, and treatment of date ranges and location data) and more complex categorization, concept taxonomy, and filtering. These last 3 rounds of refinement have seen full independent use of Net.Create for research by faculty and graduate students both with and without IU affiliation.

These most recent rounds of revision have also been focused on methods design--in otherwords, insight into the best ways to shorten the learning curve experienced historians have as they connect their traditional historical methods skillsets to network-analysis skillsets and determine how and when they should critique or question the network analysis results of their data entry. Our understanding of how to use Net.Create to shorten the learning curve for experienced historians has formed the basis for a current research partnership with Dr. Collin Elliot and an undergraduate researcher that explores the role of gendered network formation in late-Antique Roman politics.

Any digital-history tool-design claims need to be vetted by reviewers and users. I've drawn on three separate approaches to make that possible for Net.Create:

- faculty and graduate student research workshops and consults to assess Net.Create's value for humanities network-analysis research;
- in-classroom testing to evaluate the tool's practical value for novice researchers
- expert-reviewer feedback through grants, peer-reviewed articles, and private-foundation use.

Independent use of Net.Create by humanities researchers outside of the more formal assessment channels I developed has also been a vital part of Net.Create's design, review, testing and development process.

Finally, Net.Create is the site of ongoing private-foundation funded research-driven public-policy work. The [Council for Public Liberal Arts Colleges](https://coplac.org){:target="_blank"} and [Lumina Foundation](https://www.luminafoundation.org){:target="_blank"} separately asked for assessments of their existing networks of activist and higher-education-policy world. In the case of Lumina Foundation, Ann McCranie, Kate Eddens and I are currently engaged in a grant-funded analysis that draws on oral history, ethnograpy, and Net.Create's debate- and citation-oriented network-analysis design to lay out the contours of Lumina's last decade of activistm and help them shape the contacts they make in higher-education policy strategy over the next decade. We are currently writing a follow-up grant for submission in September of 2022.

## Design-Based History Research as public history

### History Harvests

In parallel with Net.Create, I've spent the last few years working in digital-public-history spaces with partners both on- and off-campus. The most rewarding and future-facing of those projects is a series of History Harvests, which collect and present a digital collection of artifacts that have historical significance but acknowledge that the physical objects need to remain with the families whose history they represent. These History Harvests started as [service-learning digital-public-history projects rooted in classrooms](https://historyharvest.indiana.edu/){:target="_blank"}; I organized 2 public collection days in 2019, helped with a third, and led the narrative-writing and digitization processes to launch all three digital exhibits in 2020 and 2021. The challenges and potential research opportunities that persisted across all of the History Harvests have since become a focus of my very recent and near-future design-based history research.

[![Remembering Freedom History Harvest](/assets/img/associate/RememberingFreedom.png){:.float-right}](https://longtownhistory.github.io){:target="_blank"}One History Harvest in particular helped me identify a need for historical-methods design expertise in the community-archive corner of the digital-cultural-heritage preservation world: [Remembering Freedom](https://longtownhistory.github.io){:target="_blank"}, done in collaboration with Dr. Jazma Sutton, a recent IU PhD recipient, and a descendant community of one of the largest pre-Civil-War free Black communities in Longtown, Ohio. Partnerships between communities like Longtown and university-based digital-history, digital-cultural-heritage, library-science and archival-preservation experts have generated a wide variety of community-preservation projects over the last decade. Many of these projects are driven by community preservation needs but shaped by cultural-heritage-preservation or library-sciences research priorities that privilege high-quality preservation and complex discoverability strategies. Working directly with the Longtown community on both preservation and oral history brought a historian's eye to the issues that historically-excluded communities face as they collect, preserve, narrate, and publish their own collections.

The two most pressing of these concerns don't have easy solutions. Community rights, access, and ownership needs are often at odds with scholarly preservation and research-discoverability goals. Oral-history release forms regularly transfer ownership of the digital assets to academic partners, which can strip community control over, and rights to, their own history. Similarly, while there are a number of tool kits that are free to use for the preservation of community cultural-heritage collections, many are built to prioritize discoverability for researchers rather than community-led narratives. At the same time, approaches to the design of a community-archive collection should be informed by, and help ethically support, the research practices of historians like Dr. Sutton whose life work has been to uncover hidden histories.

Solving these community-oriented DBHR challenges will require someone with both technical skills and an historian’s sensitivity to the needs of the people whose stories are being collected. Working with partners at the [IXeM Collective](https://www.instagram.com/ixemcollective/?hl=en){:target="_blank"} and the [Institute for Digital Arts and Humanities](https://idah.indiana.edu){:target="_blank"}, and drawing on a variety of literatures focused on historically excluded communities, I've begun development on the [Community-Archive Toolkit](https://community-archive.kalanicraig.com), which prioritizes low-cost community-owned platforms with [minimal-computing requirements](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/index.html){:target="_blank"} for building community public-history digital collections. The tool-kit includes a website template; video and online tutorials to use that template; and example release forms that offer a variety of ownership and discoverability options. With no high-end cameras or costly web hosts required for the toolkit, communities can choose to partner with an institution like IU or work independently to host their collections and maintain ownership of their work.

[![Community-Archive Toolkit](/assets/img/associate/CommunityArchive.png){:.float-right}](https://community-archive.kalanicraig.com){:target="_blank"}The Community-Archive Toolkit is only partially built, in that it addresses only the bare minimum of the challenges that have presented themselves over several History Harvest iterations. In addition to filters and tags that allow community members to organize their collections by category--and more importantly, to show and hide parts of their collections for selective sharing with researchers and the general public--the Community-Archive Toolkit needs to be tested more broadly to ensure that it does support the balance between community ownership and research discoverability that motivated its initial development. Some of that work has begun; the toolkit has already been built into a dissertation for a new PhD from the Claremont Graduate School, attesting to the need for such a tool. It will also be the main platform for several digital-public-history projects in partnership with IDAH and IXEM that have planned collection dates in Fall of 2022 and Spring of 2023 and collection launch dates in 2023 and 2024.

## Design-Based History Research in digital-history method development

Both Net.Create and the Community-Archive Toolkit are illustrative of my goal to foster disciplinary change and historical-methods innovation through my DBHR portfolio. The arguments I wanted to make about episcopal networks as a late-stage graduate student and early-career historian were impossible because the tools I needed didn't exist yet. For historians with similar questions but without my unusual skillset at the crossroads of advanced historial methods, theoreticaly motivated design, and digital tool building, these are insurmountable barriers.

The final aspect of my work addresses these barriers through structured collaborations that articulate methods-driven approaches for using these digital tools as analytical and presentation platforms in the production of argument-driven historical scholarship. Social-science and hard-science disciplines offer a number of well-articulated methods for collaboration that offer repeatable steps and specific analytical pathways. History needs similarly well-articulated methods that accommodate the individual theoretical frameworks of each historian involved in a collaboration. We also need to account for the fact that, while interpretive hermeneutics make repeatabiity in historical research not only impossible but less-than-ideal, we would benefit as a field from a procedural guide for well-structured collaborative research. An article on the connection between the Longtown History Harvest and its historical antecedents, first-authored by Dr. Sutton, highlighted the need for a structured methods approach that helps historians position their individual scholarship in the context of a research partnership. A collaborative text-analysis piece currently in progress with Arlene Diaz will introduce the next stage of that structure: Mixed-Method Approaches to Collaborative History (MMATCH). MMATCH is a process through which historians can document the overlaps in interpretation and method that make collaboration a generative process for new historical research, and Dr. Diaz and I have identified the [American Historical Review's History Lab](https://www.historians.org/ahr-history-lab){:target="_blank"} section as an ideal submission venue. I'm also drawing on MMATCH to help organize and integrate the analysis jointly produced by Dr. Eliott, Ms. Zafar, and me in our article on Tacitus' networks.
