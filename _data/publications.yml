From 2018 to the present, I am responsible for leading feature-development-design and activity-design processes for research and higher-ed classroom use, am the primary documentation author, am the project lead for one-click-install development, and have done 10-15% of the user-interface design coding; a colleague leads the technical communication and quality-assurance conversations with an agile-development team, who are responsible for ongoing implementation of new feature requests."

Today, Greenville/Longtown descendants have several grassroots preservation efforts in place. This History Harvest, which took place in September 2019, is an exciting addition to those preservation practices."
  collaboration: "I developed the surveys that allowed History Harvest participants to contribute memories and objects, worked with the onsite collection-day team to develop interview and object capture processes, led the post-collection-day efforts to clean and prepare object photos and interviews, structured the web site content into sections to best present the historical preservation work done by both the Longtown descendants and the History Harvest team, and continue to provide support to the community for ongoing updates"

  status: "Awarded May, 2023; Active May 1, 2023 - April 30, 2026."
  date: "2023-05-15"
  info: "The Visualizing Funds of Identity while Exploring Data Literacy Concepts grant responds to the growing recognition that data literacy is an increasingly important set of skills. and network science in particular is at the heart of today’s youth’s experiences with technology. The goal of this project is to explore an approach in which middle school students in an underserved school district use network visualization in classrooms across the curriculum to learn about themselves and their communities, while simultaneously learning about the underlying network science and data literacy principles that are central to their experiences with many common technologies. The project team will design, implement, and study an instructional unit about network visualization using the open-source Net.Create software tool on which I was PI. My role will be to lead the integration of network analysis with history and humanities learning. I will also be responsible for the dissemination of the tool and study results to digital-history research and history-pedagogy communities."
  collaboration: "I led the mapping process between historical thinking activities and data literacy standards and will lead the historical-thinking feature and activity co-design process for this grant."

  date: "2018-08-01"
  info: "Network analysis is an increasingly popular and powerful computational tool for the analysis of large data sets. Digital historians have used these tools to represent and analyze historical contexts because they support scholars in looking at a broad range of connections between people, places, and events. This NSF EAGER award funded Net.Create, an easy-to use interface to support the collaborative generation and interpretation of network data drawn from multiple historical texts, and the application of network analysis to understand the complexity of historical interactions. Net.Create's innovations are focused on simultaneous multi-user predictive network data entry and live visualization, two features designed to directly elicit historical argumentation and interpretation in collaborative environments."
  collaboration: "I led the project team, including identifying partners in IU's School of Education and led the resulting team in the grant-writing and budgeting process. During the grant's active period, I served as the main project leader, led the feature- and activity-design process for the software and people's interactions with it, the analysis process, and the writing for 2 of the 3 primary article outputs."
